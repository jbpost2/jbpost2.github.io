## Statistical Learning Group

For a few years I had the pleasure of being the faculty mentor to the
statistical learning group (SLG). The group was originally formed by
[Jami Jackson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jami-mulgrave-ph-d-3419445/),
[Neal Grantham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nsgrantham/), [Joshua
Day](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshday/), [Dendi
Suhubdy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dendisuhubdy/), and [Brian
Gaines](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briangainesstats/). Later Todd
Wilson and [Kara
Martinez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kara-martinez-1163a4152/) led the
group. All awesome people!

The group had four major goals:

-   Introduce advanced topics in data mining, machine learning, and
    other ‘active’ areas of statistics in order to broaden the students’
    knowledge base and, where possible, connect statistical ideas.
    -   With the “Data Science” revolution, these methods became very
        important to have an understanding of
-   Offer opportunities to present upper level topics and improve
    presentation and teaching ability with a focus on audience of the
    presentation and data visualizations.
    -   Provide presenting students ‘mentors’ to help them effectively
        present.
-   Give outlets for presentation, writing, and computing that are
    available for prospective employers to view.
    -   Many of the presentations were recorded and made available.
    -   Write-ups and code were made available when possible as well.
-   Improve applied analysis skills and coding.
    -   Presentations included an analysis or simulation aspect with
        code available for all members to work through when possible.

As our curriculum caught up, the need for the group diminished (and I
had my first child :). The group did have a brief resurgence just prior
to the pandemic. [Jimmy
Hickey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmyjhickey/) and [Alvin
Sheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvin-sheng-b06351110/) led a reading
group for the book [Deep Learning with
R](https://github.com/AlvinSheng/SLG-Deep-Learning).

If you are interested, I’m placed some of the [presentations
here](SLGpresentations.html).
