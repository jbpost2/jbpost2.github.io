## Basics of R

As part of our efforts to prepare our Online Master of Statistics and
Applied Statistics and Data Management Certificate students, we’ve
developed this short course on learning to use the R software.

The course is a free, open, non-credit course and is meant to provide
training to our current graduate students on the basics of R so that
learning how to use R doesn’t hinder their learning in the courses that
use R in our programs.

## Course Goals

This course is designed to demonstrate the basic use of R for reading,
manipulating, and plotting data via RStudio. By the end of this course
students will be able to:

- read and write basic R programs
- import well-formatted raw data into R using the `tidyverse`
- complete common data manipulation tasks in R using the `tidyverse`
- produce numerical and graphical summaries in R in `baseR` and the
  `tidyverse`
