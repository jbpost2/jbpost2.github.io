## <a name = "DataMatters"></a> Data Matters Courses

Justin taught the following three courses for [Data
Matters](https://datamatters.org/), a week-long series of one and
two-day courses aimed at students and professionals in business,
research, and government from 2016-2021. The material is open to anyone.
Feel free to use these materials for any educational purpose!

### Basics of R for Data Science and Statistics

#### Course description

This course introduces the powerful and popular R statistical software
through the RStudio integrated development environment. R is fully
developed programming language and one of the major platforms for doing
data science. This course covers frequently used data structures,
importing raw data, common data manipulations, summary statistics, and
data visualizations through the suite of packages called the tidyverse.

#### Course Outline

The course provides a modern introduction to the R through the extremely
popular suite of packages called the tidyverse. A rough outline is given
below:

Day 1:

-   Basics of how R stores data
-   R Packages and the tidyverse
-   Reading data from common formats into R (readr package)
-   Using R Markdown for reproducibility (rmarkdown and knitr packages)
-   Common data manipulations and creating new variables (dplyr package)

Day 2:

-   Reshaping data for summarizing and modeling (tidyr package)
-   Types of data and numeric summaries (including across groups)
-   Creating publication ready graphs (ggplot2 package)

### Improving R Programs

#### Course description

This course introduces common programming techniques that can improve
the efficiency of your R programs. These techniques include the use of
loops and vectorized functions to avoid repeated sections of code. To
really take R programs to the next level, weâ€™ll see how to write custom
functions that will help to streamline code.

#### Course Outline

The course provides a brief overview of R data structures followed by
the following topics:

-   Loops in R
-   Vectorized functions (apply family of functions)
-   How R functions work
-   Function writing

### R for Automating Workflow & Sharing Work

#### Course description

The course provides participants an introduction to utilizing R for
writing reproducible reports and presentations that easily embed R
output, using online repositories and version control software for
collaboration, creation of basic websites using R, and the development
of interactive dashboards and web applets.

#### Course Outline

Students will learn about the following topics:

-   The R Markdown language
-   How to automate reports with R Markdown
-   Use of git and github for collaboration and version control
-   Basic creation of websites through Markdown and github
-   R Shiny web apps

## <a name = "TeachingWithR"></a> Teaching With R

USCOTS 2021

This workshop is intended to provide an introduction to data wrangling
and visualization using packages from the tidyverse, creating
reproducible analyses using RMarkdown, and producing basic interactivity
using R Shiny. Topics will be introduced with examples. Participants
will then do small activities in breakout rooms that will give them a
chance to try out the code and concepts.

Participants should leave this workshop being able to create HTML
documents that provide documentation of their work, do common
manipulations of data, produce customized graphics, and allow for
interactivity with R using the shiny package.

This workshop will be most beneficial for those that have some basic
programming experience, although not necessarily in R.

Participants should come with R and RStudio installed and will need to
have permission to download packages onto their computer.
