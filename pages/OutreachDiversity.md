## Stat’n’Chat

The Stat’n’Chat group is a collection of some local introductory
statistics instructors from different high schools/colleges/universities
that have gotten together to network and share ideas. We’ve had people
from NC State, Wake Tech Community College, Meredith College, Cary
Academy, and a few others.

We usually meet monthly on Friday for dinner and discussion. If you are
interested in joining, please e-mail me and I’ll add you to our mailing
list!

## Cary Academy

In progress <!--
Met Craig Lazarski and Kristi Ramey @ cary academy

## Juntos

Juntos is a program that NC State started in 2007 to ‘provide high
school Latino students and their families with the knowledge, skills,
and resources to ensure high school graduate and increase college access
and attendance rates.’

I got started with the group in 2017 when one of our undergraduate
students did a project with them. After meeting with them, we decided to
have an undergraduate internship/research type position there for a few
semesters. During this time I helped them to completely revamp their
data collection and reporting processes (we went from individual excel
files and manually tabulation to a database with an online form their
mentors could use with automated reporting). Our student [Didier
Turcios](https://www.linkedin.com/in/didierturcios/) held the internship
position there for a year and now serves as their program evaluator!
(He’s also a current statistician at RTI International and in our online
master’s of statistics program.)

This is a really fantastic program and I’m happy to have been involved!

## Cary PD

In 2017 I advised [Grant
Swigart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantswigart/) on a really
interesting project with the Cary Police Department. The goal was:

> To utilize a neutral, third party subject matter expert (NCSU
> Statistics) to proactively analyze Cary PD’s traffic stops on both an
> aggregate and individual level and determine if we have any
> statistically significant deviations from a normal range as it relates
> to officer traffic stops, searches, and arrests of women, persons of
> color and Hispanic heritage. Our benchmark/point of comparison will be
> the gender, race, and heritage of persons involved in traffic
> collisions as captured by Cary PD’s traffic collision reports. These
> data are much more representative of who makes up the motoring public
> than census data, which is designed purely to captures residency
> information. Statistical deviations from the norm in and of themselves
> will not to be considered indicative of wrongdoing, but rather will
> serve as an impetus to further examine the circumstances involved with
> the officer or group of officers outside the normal range.

Grant did a great job working through the data and literature (he
ultimately went on to get a master’s degree in statistics from NC
State). Ultimately we stopped hearing back from the Cary PD after our
initial findings of some differences in traffic stop distributions.

## GLBT advocate

> The GLBT Advocate Program is intended to be a continuing education and
> engagement program for NC State faculty and staff. The Program is
> designed to provide faculty and staff with ongoing opportunities for
> learning and for showing their support as Allies and Advocates of the
> GLBT community. Faculty and staff who would like to participate in the
> Program agree to complete one educational workshop and attend one GLBT
> event on campus each year.

I’ve enjoyed being a [GLBT
advocate](https://diversity.ncsu.edu/glbt/glbt-advocate-list/) since
2017. The program is really educational and has helped me to understand
barriers and issues faced by those in the GLBT community.

## Pack Promise Mentor

[Pack Promise](https://news.ncsu.edu/tag/pack-promise/) is a great
program for families with limited financial resources. Students from
these families tend to be first-generation college students. As a first
generation college student myself, I was really glad to see NC State has
a program to help guide students through the unknowns of a large
university. I served as a Pack Promise faculty mentor to a stats major
(she now has a master’s degree in statistics!). We met each semester to
talk about clubs to get involved with, opportunities within the
department and campus, and generally answered any questions about how
things work at the university. All things I wish I had when I was an
undergraduate student! (I never even considered graduate school until my
senior year of college!)
