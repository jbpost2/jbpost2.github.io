## Basics of SAS

As part of our efforts to prepare our Online Master of Statistics and
Applied Statistics and Data Management Certificate students, we’ve
developed this short course on learning to use the SAS software.

The course is a free, open, non-credit course and is meant to provide
training to our current graduate students on the basics of SAS so that
learning how to use SAS doesn’t hinder their learning in the courses
that use SAS in our programs.

## Course Goals

This course is designed to demonstrate the basic use of SAS for reading,
manipulating, and plotting data via SAS Studio. How to conduct a basic
correlation and regression analysis is also discussed.

By the end of this course students will be able to: - read and write SAS
programs  
\- import well-formatted raw data into SAS  
\- complete common data manipulation tasks in SAS  
\- produce numerical and graphical summaries in SAS - conduct a basic
correlation and regression analysis
