## Online Education

At this point all educators are pretty familiar with teaching online!
Luckily I began teaching online pre-pandemic which allowed for a smooth
transition during ‘the COVID years’ (shutters). I started teaching ST
501/502 (Fundamentals of Statistical Inference I/II) in the online
format for our
<a href = "https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/graduate/online-programs/" target = "_blank">online
master of statistics program</a> in 2015. I took over as director of the
online program (and certificate program) in 2018 and lead the program
until the spring of 2025.

Learning online requires a lot of self-motivation and discipline for the
learner to be successful. While this isn’t ideal for the typical
undergraduate, I really believe that online education at the graduate
level provides a fantastic opportunity to help people retool or upscale
their careers.

## Director of Online Education

My main role was to improve and develop our online master of statistics
and graduate certificate in applied statistics and data management
programs. I also provided guidance for other online/hybrid course
offerings in our department (hence the shuttering thinking back on the
beginning of the pandemic and the massive shift to *everything* being
online).

In this role I had the opportunity to rethink the graduate program
curriculum and course offerings. I designed new courses in Data Science
(ST 558) and Big Data Analysis (ST 554) to fill gaps in the curriculum
as well as redesigning dated courses to include more **practice actually
doing statistics** using software. I attempted to push our faculty to
incorporate computing into all of our courses.

I met a ton of awesome and interesting people in our online programs. If
you are interested, there are
<a href= "https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/graduate/online-programs/online-students-faculty/" target ="_blank">articles
about some of them here</a>!

### Oversight of Hybrid Courses

As part of the role I had oversight of some of our large enrollment
undergraduate courses that are taught in a hybrid or flipped manner with
graduate students hosting the in-person portions of the class.

- ST 311 – Introduction to Statistics (direct oversight one semester)
- ST 307 – Introduction to Statistical Programming – R
- ST 308 – Introduction to Statistical Programming – SAS

Each of 311 and 307/308 enrolls approximately 800 students per regular
semester.

## Faculty Fellows

From 2018 to 2020 I served as a
<a href = "https://delta.ncsu.edu/about-delta/meet-our-faculty-fellows/" target = "_blank">DELTA
Faculty Fellow</a>. DELTA (Digital Education and Learning Technology
Applications) is the group on campus that handles and trains people on
most all of our
<a href = "https://ncsu.service-now.com/delta?id=delta_home" target = "_blank">digital
education components (Moodle, Zoom, Panopto, etc.)</a>. DELTA is really
the group that sets our university up for success in the online space. I
can’t say enough great things about the people over there!

As a faculty fellow I had the opportunity to discuss teaching best
practices for online and flipped courses, training of teaching
assistants, and more! See the
<a href = "ArticlesWorkshops.html" target = "_blank">articles,
workshops, quantititative literacy, & more</a> page for more details.

## Quality Matters (QM) course certification

Through a DELTA grant (did I mention they are awesome?) I was able to
gain further training in teaching online and obtain
<a href = "https://www.qualitymatters.org/" target = "_blank">QM
certification</a> for my ST 558 - Data Science for Statisticians course.

There is a
<a href = "https://delta.ncsu.edu/course-planning/delta-grants/" target = "_blank">dedicated
group at DELTA</a> (led by Bethanne Winzeler and Jill Anderson) that
takes a cohort of faculty through the QM certification process each
year. I have happily served as a faculty mentor for other folks going
through QM certification process!
