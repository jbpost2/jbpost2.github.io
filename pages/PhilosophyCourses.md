## Philosophy

<div style="float: right; padding: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">

</div>

As a teacher, my goals are to make students feel welcome and supported
in the classroom, motivate them to learn the material, and engage them
in a discussion of that material that leads to a deeper understanding of
the concepts involved. By using active learning and involving them in a
discussion of the material, students are forced to truly grapple with
the ideas. This can foster the critical thinking and problem-solving
skills they need to succeed in and out of the classroom.

To me, the most important aspect of teaching is to create a comfortable,
inclusive, and interactive learning environment for our students. A
welcoming classroom makes students feel confident enough to voice their
questions and opinions and begin a dialogue with us. To create a
positive environment it is important to treat students with respect. For
me, this starts with a positive tone on the syllabus, setting clear
expectations for success from the start, and asking for feedback
throughout the semester. I give students many opportunities to interact
with each other through activities such as think-pair-share or, for
online courses, padlets. This helps them gain confidence discussing the
material with each other and, ultimately, makes them more willing to
interact in the classroom learning community.

<div style="float: right; padding: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">

<img src = "../images/motivation.png" alt = "Motivation image." width = "350">

</div>

To help motivate students, I am careful to use examples that are
meaningful to the students and often highlight issues important to
people. For instance, I recently created a number of interactive
in-class activities that utilize census data around important issues the
students have an interest in.

One activity uses the Normal distribution to approximate the
distribution of money spent on rent across census tracts within a state.
Students select a state and can find probabilities and quantiles around
these distributions and compare them with the actual observed values
from the census. They then have the option to compare those values to
another state’s values and can view the data on a map to understand how
those scores relate to nearby cities and counties.

Another activity allows students to construct regression lines between
census variables (such as hours worked per week, travel time to work,
gross rent as a percentage of income, and electricity cost) and compare
them for different subgroups of the population (receiving SNAP benefits
or not, obtained a college degree or not, and household language
primarily English or not).

These types of activities allow students to explore the statistical
concepts in problems where they are able to investigate what is of
interest to them. This autonomy leads to a more invested inquiry and a
deeper understanding of the material and how it can be applied to
important questions.

A technique I use to help students conceptualize material is bringing a
narrative to the course at the beginning of the semester. In a
face-to-face class, I start each class with a discussion of where we are
in our narrative, what we are doing, and why we are doing it. This
encourages discussions between myself and the students and helps promote
active engagement by breaking down the usual passive learning,
lecturer/listener paradigm. Having the students answer these questions
each class and seeing how their classmates answer keeps them grounded in
what we are doing and helps them gauge how well they understand the
concepts we are focusing on. In online courses I emulate this practice
by recording videos and including questions throughout. This helps the
students to engage with the material and reflect on their learning
process. Students often comment on this focus on the ‘what and why,’
noting that it really helps them to stay engaged in lectures and apply
the material. I also emphasize assessing students’ ability to answer
these what and why questions. Having seen the questions asked each
class, they have a clear understanding of the level they’ll be assessed
at. The students are more motivated to achieve when they can easily see
what they need to do to prosper in the course.

Purposeful assessments are another way in which we can engage students
deeply with the material. Along with the usual low stakes assessments, I
love to give my students concept-map assignments, real-data projects,
and open-ended assignments. I often require group work in these larger
assignments to force the students to explain and defend their thinking
to their peers. These types of assessments require purposeful
communication, problem solving, and high-level critical thinking that
truly leads to a deeper, longer-lasting understanding. To further push
students to create high quality work, in many of my courses I’ve moved
to having the students create webpages (using GitHub) for their larger
assignments and projects. These sites are public facing and, when done
well, provide a great addition to their professional portfolio.

Of course, with teaching, our demeanor is essential to obtain student
buy-in. I’m very careful to show the passion and enthusiasm for their
learning on a daily basis. I make sure that they know I am there to
support them and help them achieve at the highest level. In all of my
courses I am unwaveringly positive when a student participates, whether
they are right or wrong in their answer. The contribution is useful even
when it is wrong as it allows us to discuss how we may have gone off
track. These efforts make students feel comfortable and that we have a
mutual vested interest in the course.

</div>

Lastly, teaching requires that we do our best to never become passive. I
am always refining my craft and learning new pedagogy. Each class will
be different, we must adapt for the current batch of students. The
students ten years from now will surely be as different as students from
ten years ago. To keep up, I make sure to continue to go to workshops,
participate in faculty exchanges, and attend conferences.

I believe that students who are comfortable in their learning
environment, motivated to learn, and deeply engaged with the material
can most easily develop their problem solving and high-level critical
thinking skills that will help them be successful in life!

If you are currently enrolled in one of these courses, the material for
the classes is available on

I’ve also taught Calculus II and Differential Equations at the
University of Mount Union.

## Professional Development

I’ve taught professional development workshops many times over the
years. These mostly are concerned with statistical programming. You can
find information about these courses on my [open education
page](OpenEd.html).
