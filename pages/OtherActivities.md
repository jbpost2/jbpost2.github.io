For a few years I had the pleasure of being the faculty mentor to the statistical learning group (SLG).  The group was originally formed by Jami Jackson, Neal Grantham, Joshua Day, Dendi Suhubdy, and Brian Gaines. Later Todd Wilson and Kara Martinez led the group. 

The group had four major goals:

- Introduce advanced topics in data mining, machine learning, and other 'active' areas of statistics in order to broaden the students' knowledge base and, where possible, connect statistical ideas. 
    + With the "Data Science" revolution, these methods became very important to have an understanding of
- Offer opportunities to present upper level topics and improve presentation and teaching ability with a focus on audience of the presentation and data visualizations.
    + Provide presenting students 'mentors' to help them effectively present.
- Give outlets for presentation, writing, and computing that are available for prospective employers to view.
    + Many of the presentations were recorded and made available.
    + Write-ups and code were made available when possible as well.
- Improve applied analysis skills and coding.
    + Presentations included an analysis or simulation aspect with code available for all members to work through when possible.

As our curriculum caught up, the need for the group diminished (and I had my first child :). The group did have a brief resurgence just prior to the pandemic.  Jimmy Hickey and Alvin Sheng led a reading group for the book [Deep Learning with R](https://github.com/AlvinSheng/SLG-Deep-Learning). 

If you are interested, I'm placed some of the [presentations here](SLGpresentations.html).

## Undergrad Research

Having a strong undergraduate research program is important to the university, college, and department. As a university, NCSU wants to be the state university system's school of choice for students who want a research-rich undergraduate education. As a department we believe that undergraduate research is an essential part of the curriculum and that every student should get involved as early and often as they can.

By engaging in research and communication of this research, students will begin to look at their work in different ways, to develop new ideas for future projects, and to improve their personal communication skills.

Independent research with the goal of creating a publically-accessible product is beneficial for all undergraduates, regardless of discipline or future career plans. Students will gain tangible experience in addressing real-world problems, increasing their overall value to prospective employers. A recent survey of employers demonstrates that skills and aptitudes gained through research are highly valued in the workplace.

A good undergraduate research project for a statistics major should including using software, striking demonstrations, (hopefully) real-data analysis, and effective communication, both oral and written.


Of course not everyone is ready to do effective research right away. It is my job to help provide resources and facilitate projects so that they will be successful both for faculty and students.

Here are 5 skills http://www.cur.org/assets/1/7/333Spring13Showman16-20.pdf needed for every undergraduate researcher.

Pack Promise is a... 

As a first generation college student myself, I'm really glad NC State has a program to help guide students through the unknowns of a large university.  When I first attended college I had no real idea about the types of opportunities that are available and which to focus on.  In fact, I had never even considered graduate school until my senior year of college!
