## <a href = "https://jbpost2.github.io/R4Reproducibility/" target="_blank">R4Reproducibility</a>

At the <a href = "https://testscience.org/dataworks-sessions-archive/?session=Short%20Course" target = "_blank">2022 Dataworks</a> conference I gave a workshop called `R4Reproducibility`.

The goal of the workshop was to teach common data manipulation and summary measures through the use of the `tidyverse` while emphasizing the creation of reproducibile workflows through `R Markdown`.
