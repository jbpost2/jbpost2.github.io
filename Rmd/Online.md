## Online Education

At this point all educators are pretty familiar with teaching online!
Luckily I began teaching online pre-pandemic which allowed for a smooth
transition during ‘the COVID years’ (shutters). I started teaching ST
501/502 (Fundamentals of Statistical Inference I/II) in the online
format for our
<a href = "https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/graduate/online-programs/" target = "_blank">online
master of statistics program</a> in 2015. I took over as director of the
online program (and certificate program) in 2018 and since then have
been almost solely teaching online and developing online courses.

Learning online requires a lot of self-motivation and discipline for the
learner to be successful. While this isn’t ideal for the typical
undergraduate, I really believe that online education at the graduate
level provides a fantastic opportunity to help people retool or upscale
their careers.

## Director of Online Education

My main role is to improve and develop our online master of statistics
and graduate certificate in applied statistics and data management
programs. I also provide guidance for other online/hybrid course
offerings in our department (hence the shuttering thinking back on the
beginning of the pandemic and the massive shift to *everything* being
online).

In this role I’ve had the opportunity to rethink the graduate program
curriculum and course offerings. I’ve designed new courses in Data
Science (ST 558) and Big Data Analysis (ST 554) to fill gaps in the
curriculum and as well as redesigning dated courses to include more
**practice doing statistics** using software.

As we try to incorporate computing into all of our courses, there was a
clear need for supplemental basic programming courses to get everyone up
to speed. I developed courses in [R](R.html) and [SAS](SAS.html) (python
coming soon) which are freely available to anyone, not just our graduate
students.

### Oversight of Hybrid Courses

As part of the role I’ve also had oversight of some of our large
enrollment undergraduate courses that are taught in a hybrid or flipped
manner with graduate students hosting the in-person portions of the
class.

-   ST 311 – Introduction to Statistics (direct oversight one semester)
-   ST 307 – Introduction to Statistical Programming – R
-   ST 308 – Introduction to Statistical Programming – SAS

Each of 311 and 307/308 enrolls approximately 800 students per regular
semester.

## Faculty Fellows

From 2018 to 2020 I served as a
<a href = "https://delta.ncsu.edu/about-delta/meet-our-faculty-fellows/" target = "_blank">DELTA
Faculty Fellow</a>. DELTA (Digital Education and Learning Technology
Applications) is the group on campus that handles and trains people on
most all of our
<a href = "https://ncsu.service-now.com/delta?id=delta_home" target = "_blank">digital
education components (Moodle, Zoom, Panopto, etc.)</a>. DELTA is really
the group that sets our university up for success in the online space. I
can’t say enough great things about the people over there!

As a faculty fellow I had the opportunity to discuss teaching best
practices for online and flipped courses, training of teaching
assistants, and more!

## Quality Matters (QM) course certification

Through a DELTA grant (did I mention they are awesome?) I was able to
gain further training in teaching online and obtain
<a href = "https://www.qualitymatters.org/" target = "_blank">QM
certification</a> for my ST 558 - Data Science for Statisticians course.

There is a
<a href = "https://delta.ncsu.edu/course-planning/delta-grants/" target = "_blank">dedicated
group at DELTA</a> (led by Bethanne Winzeler and Jill Anderson) that
takes a cohort of faculty through the QM certification process each
year. I now happily serve as a faculty mentor for other folks going
through QM certification process!
