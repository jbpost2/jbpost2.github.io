## Philosophy

</div> 

To facilitate success for our students and ultimately our programs, we should start at the administrative level by setting a **welcoming tone**, providing **thoughtful and dedicated advising**, and having a **purposeful and inclusive curriculum**.  By setting **clear expectations** and having **open lines of communication** students can gauge how they are progressing in the program and if they are at risk or in need of help.  We should intentionally create spaces and hold events to allow for informal interactions that help to promote a generally **comfortable and welcoming environment** for everyone.

In an instructor role, I believe many of these same themes are vital.  When teaching, my goals are to get *every* student excited and **motivated to learn**.  I want to engage them in a discussion of the material that leads to a deeper understanding of both the details and the big picture concepts involved. By really involving them in this discussion, **critical thinking** and **problem solving** strategies can be honed and improved.  To help our students thrive, creating a comfortable and interactive learning environment where students are free to question you and the material is of paramount importance.  

There are many ways I try to accomplish these goals when teaching, including:  

- using **projects and capstone activities** that require problem solving and high-level critical thinking
- engaging in **discussions with students** during class or through discussion forums  
- employing **active learning** to help students take an active role in their learning
- providing **clear expectations** for the day, topic, and semester 
- utilizing **interesting, relevant, and culturally sensitive motivating examples**
- teaching with **passion and enthusiasm** that is evident on a daily basis
- obtaining **feedback** from our students to gauge misunderstandings and muddy points
- implementing a **constant cycle of improvement** from semester to semester

I believe that if we can accomplish these goals, the sky is the limit for the learning that will occur in our classrooms and our programs. We can get the students interested and motivated about our material, we can get them to develop high-level critical thinking skills, and we can truly teach them skills and information they can use and take into the real world.
