## Basics of R  

As part of our efforts to prepare our Online Master of Statistics and Applied Statistics and Data Management Certificate students, we've developed this short course on learning to use the R software.  

The course is a free, open, non-credit course and is meant to provide training to our current graduate students on the basics of R so that learning how to use R doesnâ€™t hinder their learning in the courses that use R in our programs.

## Course Goals

This course is designed to demonstrate the basic use of R for reading, manipulating, and plotting data via RStudio.  By the end of this course students will be able to:  

- read and write basic R programs
- import well-formatted raw data into R using the `tidyverse`
- complete common data manipulation tasks in R using the `tidyverse`
- produce numerical and graphical summaries in R in `baseR` and the `tidyverse`  

## Joining the Course  

The course will be made available soon.
