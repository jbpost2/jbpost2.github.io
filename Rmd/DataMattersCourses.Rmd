### <a href = "https://jbpost2.github.io/Basics-of-R-for-Data-Science-and-Statistics/CourseFiles.html" target = "_blank">Basics of R for Data Science and Statistics</a>  

#### Course description 

This course introduces the powerful and popular `R` statistical software through the RStudio integrated development environment. `R` is fully developed programming language and one of the major platforms for doing data science. This course covers frequently used data structures, importing raw data, common data manipulations, summary statistics, and data visualizations through the suite of packages called the `tidyverse`.

#### Course Outline

The course provides a modern introduction to the `R` through the extremely popular suite of packages called the `tidyverse`. A rough outline is given below:

Day 1:

- Basics of how `R` stores data
- `R` packages and the `tidyverse`
- Reading data from common formats into `R` (`readr` package)
- Using `R Markdown` for reproducibility (`rmarkdown` and `knitr` packages)
- Common data manipulations and creating new variables (`dplyr` package)

Day 2:

- Reshaping data for summarizing and modeling (`tidyr` package)
- Types of data and numeric summaries (including across groups)
- Creating publication ready graphs (`ggplot2` package)

###  <a href = "https://jbpost2.github.io/Improving-R-Programs/CourseFiles.html" target = "_blank">Improving R Programs </a>

#### Course description 

This course introduces common programming techniques that can improve the efficiency of your `R` programs. These techniques include the use of loops and vectorized functions to avoid repeated sections of code. To really take `R` programs to the next level, weâ€™ll see how to write custom functions that will help to streamline code.

#### Course Outline

The course provides a brief overview of `R` data structures followed by the following topics:

- Loops in `R`
- Vectorized functions (`apply` family of functions)
- How `R` functions work
- Function writing

###  <a href = "https://jbpost2.github.io/R-for-Automating-Workflow-Sharing-Work/CourseFiles.html" target = "_blank">R for Automating Workflow & Sharing Work  </a>

#### Course description 

The course provides participants an introduction to utilizing `R` for writing reproducible reports and presentations that easily embed `R` output, using online repositories and version control software for collaboration, creation of basic websites using `R`, and the development of interactive dashboards and web applets.

#### Course Outline

Students will learn about the following topics:

- The `R Markdown` language
- How to automate reports with `R Markdown`
- Use of `git` and `github` for collaboration and version control
