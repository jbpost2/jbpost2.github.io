## About Me

<div style = "padding: 10px;"> Hello and thank you for visiting my web page. I am currently an Associate Teaching Professor and the Director of Online Education in the Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University.
</div>

I have been involved in the department on and off since 2007. I was a graduate student from 2007-2012 and came back to the university in 2013 as a Teaching Assistant Professor. NC State has a wonderful statistics department. If you have any questions about our graduate programs (especially our [online master's of statistics or applied statistics and data management certificate](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/graduate/online-programs/)), please don't hesitate to reach out to me at (`justin_post@ncsu.edu`)!

Education is my passion and the focus of my career. I really enjoy curriculum development and course creation, but being in the classroom (virtual or in-person) is definitely the best part of my job. I have a number of [interactive applications I use for teaching and a blog](Teaching.html) that I'm writing about teaching statistical theory if you're interested. (I'm also happy to create new apps or modify the ones I have if you have a request!) 

I'm a big proponent of open educational resources and open-source software. I've [developed a number of programming courses for professional development and student/faculty support](OpenEd.html). The materials are all freely available on github if you'd like to use them.

Recently, I've been serving as the Director of Online Education in our department. The main task of this role involves administering the [online Master of Statistics and online graduate certificates programs](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/graduate/online-programs/). I head the efforts to continually improve the programs and courses, assess the program goals, plan course offerings, help advise students, support student success, train and support faculty, and market the program.

I have an oversight role for our large undergraduate introductory course (ST 311) and administer a few of our introductory programming courses (ST 307/308), which are flipped courses taught by our graduate students.
