## About Me

<div style = "padding: 10px;"> Hello and thank you for visiting my web page. I am currently an Associate Teaching Professor and the Director of Online Education in the Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University.
</div>

I have been involved in the department on and off since 2007. I was a graduate student from 2007-2012 and came back to the university in 2013 as a Teaching Assistant Professor.

As Director of Online Education I am heading the efforts to improve and grow our online program, update and oversee some of our large undergraduate introductory courses, and administer a few of our introductory programming courses (flipped courses).

Education is my passion.  I'm a big proponent of open educational resources and open-source software.  I really enjoy curriculum development and course creation.  Please peruse my site and contact me (`justin_post@ncsu.edu`) if you'd like to chat!
