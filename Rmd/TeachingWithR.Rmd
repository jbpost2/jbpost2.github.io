At the <a href = "https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/" target = "_blank">United States Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS)</a> 2021 I gave a workshop (with <a href = "https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/mdb268" target = "_blank">Matthew Beckman</a> from Penn State) called `TeachingWithR`.

The workshop was intended to provide an introduction to data wrangling and visualization using packages from the `tidyverse`, creating reproducible analyses using `R Markdown`, and producing basic interactivity using `R Shiny`. 

The goals for the workshop were that teachers would leave being able to create HTML documents that provide documentation of their work, do common manipulations of data, produce customized graphics, and allow for interactivity with `R` using the `shiny` package.
