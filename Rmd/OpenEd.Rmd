## Open Educational Materials

I've always been a fan of open source software (which is part of the reason to love R and python!). At NC State we have a great department where (almost) everyone is willing to share their materials. In an effort to continue the tradition of sharing and helping to educate everyone, I've tried to make many of my materials freely accessible online (via my <a href = "https://github.com/jbpost2?tab=repositories" target = "_blank">github account</a>). There you'll find all of the code for the [shiny apps](ShinyApps.html) I've created and a lot of statistical programming material as well.
