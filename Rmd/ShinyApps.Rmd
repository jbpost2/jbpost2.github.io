## R Shiny Apps

Creating visuals to explain concepts or to show nuances can make a huge impact on student learning.  Having visuals that can be modified by a user allows students to ask their own questions, explore, and deepen their understanding.  

<div style = "float: right;padding: 7px 7px 7px 7px;">
  <img src = "../images/hex-shiny.png" alt = "Hex sticker from RStudio" width = "200">
</div>

R Shiny is a package in R that allows for the creation of dynamic visuals that can run R code on the back end.  I use these types of apps in my teaching quite often.  Below are some of the apps I use in my classes.  All of the code for these apps is available in github repos.

### <a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/BasicBayes/" target = "_blank">Basic Bayes App</a> 

This is a basic prior/posterior visualization app.  You can see how the posterior changes under different likelihoods and prior distribution settings.  Specifically, the Beta distribution as the conjugate prior for the Binomial and the Gamma distribution as the conjugate prior for the Poisson are implemented.

### <a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/MCMC/" target = "_blank">MCMC App</a>

Metropolis Hastings visualization for an example where we know the posterior distribution.  Specifically, this app demonstrates a basic implemention of the MH algorithm for the use of a Beta prior on a Binomial likelihood.

### <a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/NormalApproximation/" target = "_blank">Normal Approx App</a>

The commonly used Normal approximations to the Binomial distribution and to the Poisson distribution are visualized in this app.  Continuity corrections are shown visually and compared to the exac and non-corrected probabilities.

### <a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/SamplingDistribution/" target = "_blank">Sampling Dist App</a>

This applet visualizes the sampling distribution of different statistics.  The parent population can easily be changed to many of the commonly named distributions.  Great for debunking the $n>30$ myth.

<a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/SamplingDistribution/" target = "_blank"><img src="../images/SamplingDist.png" alt=""></a>

### <a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/OrderStatsDist/" target = "_blank">Order Statistics App</a>

This applet simulates the distribution of an order statistic from a random sample of beta random variables.  One of the biggest issues in teaching this material is to get the students to understand that there is a distribution for, say, the smallest value from the sample!  The theory is given in the app along with a visualization of the joint distribution of two order statistics.

### <a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/NormalPower/" target = "_blank">Normal Power App</a>

A power applet to demonstrate the ideas surrounding power for a one sample mean test from a normal population with known variance.

<a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/NormalPower/" target = "_blank"><img   src="../images/Power.png" alt=""></a>

<hr class = "cool"> 

### <a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/ZScores/" target = "_blank">Z Score App</a>

A basic applet to visualize probabilities for a Normally distributed random variable and the corresponding calculation for a Standard Normal random variable.

<a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/ZScores/" target = "_blank"><img   src="../images/ZScores.png" alt=""></a>

<hr class = "cool"> 

### <a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/Delta/" target = "_blank">Delta Method App</a>

An applet to visualize and compare the first and second order delta method approximations.  Exact values for the transformation's mean can be compared to the approximated values.

<a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/Delta/" target = "_blank"><img   src="../images/Delta.png" alt=""></a>

<hr class = "cool"> 

### <a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/Transform/" target = "_blank">Transformation App</a>

An applet to visualize the transformation from a Gamma to an Inverse Gamma Random Variable.  The app attempts to show how the CDFs of the original random variable and the transformed random variable behave.  

<a href="https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/Transform/" target = "_blank"><img   src="../images/transform.png" alt=""></a>
