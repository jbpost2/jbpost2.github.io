## About Me

<div style="float:left;">

</div>

<div style="padding: 10px;">

I am currently a Teaching Professor in the Department of Statistics at
North Carolina State University.

</div>

I have been involved in the department on and off since 2007. I was a
graduate student from 2007-2012 and came back to the university in 2013
as a Teaching Assistant Professor. NC State has a wonderful statistics
department. If you have any questions about our graduate programs,
please don’t hesitate to reach out to me at (`justin_post@ncsu.edu`)!

Education is my passion and the focus of my career. I really enjoy
curriculum development and course creation, but being in the classroom
(virtual or in-person) is definitely the best part of my job. I have a
number of [interactive applications I use for teaching and a
blog](pages/Teaching.html) that I’m writing about teaching statistical
theory if you’re interested. (I’m also happy to create new apps or
modify the ones I have if you have a request!)

I’m a big proponent of open educational resources and open-source
software. I’ve [developed a number of programming courses for
professional development and student/faculty
support](pages/OpenEd.html). The materials are all freely available on
github if you’d like to use them.
