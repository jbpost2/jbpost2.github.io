## About Me

<div style="padding: 10px;">

Hello and thank you for visiting my web page. I am currently an
Associate Teaching Professor and the Director of Online Education in the
Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University.

</div>

I have been involved in the department on and off since 2007. I was a
graduate student from 2007-2012 and came back to the university in 2013
as a Teaching Assistant Professor.

As Director of Online Education I am heading the efforts to improve and
grow our online program, update and oversee some of our large
undergraduate introductory courses, and administer a few of our
introductory programming courses (flipped courses).

Education is my passion. I’m a big proponent of open educational
resources and open-source software. I really enjoy curriculum
development and course creation. Please peruse my site and contact me
(`justin_post@ncsu.edu`) if you’d like to chat\!
