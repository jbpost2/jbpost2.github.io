## About Me

Hello and thank you for visiting my web page. I am currently an
Associate Teaching Professor and the Director of Online Education in the
Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University.

</div>

I have been involved in the department on and off since 2007. I was a
graduate student from 2007-2012 and came back to the university in 2013
as a Teaching Assistant Professor. NC State has a wonderful statistics
department. If you have any questions about our graduate programs
(especially our
<a href = "https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/graduate/online-programs/" target ="_blank">online
master’s of statistics or applied statistics and data management
certificate</a>), please don’t hesitate to reach out to me at
(`justin_post@ncsu.edu`)!

Education is my passion and the focus of my career. I really enjoy
curriculum development and course creation, but being in the classroom
(virtual or in-person) is definitely the best part of my job. I have a
number of [interactive applications I use for teaching and a
blog](pages/Teaching.html) that I’m writing about teaching statistical
theory if you’re interested. (I’m also happy to create new apps or
modify the ones I have if you have a request!)

I’m a big proponent of open educational resources and open-source
software. I’ve [developed a number of programming courses for
professional development and student/faculty
support](pages/OpenEd.html). The materials are all freely available on
github if you’d like to use them.

Recently, I’ve been serving as the Director of Online Education in our
department. The main task of this role involves administering the
<a href = "https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/graduate/online-programs/" target ="_blank">online
Master of Statistics and online graduate certificates programs</a>. I
head the efforts to continually improve the programs and courses, assess
the program goals, plan course offerings, help advise students, support
student success, train and support faculty, and market the program.

I have an oversight role for our large undergraduate introductory course
(ST 311) and administer a few of our introductory programming courses
(ST 307/308), which are flipped courses taught by our graduate students.
