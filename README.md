Hello and thank you for visiting my web page. I am currently a Associate
Teaching Professor and the Director of Online Education in the
Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University.

I have been involved in the department on and off since 2007. I was a
graduate student from 2007-2012 and came back to the university in 2013
as a Teaching Assistant Professor.

We have one of the largest doctoral programs in the country, a growing
online masterâ€™s program, a large undergraduate program, and courses that
reach students across many fields of study. As awareness of the utility
of statistics and data science continues to evolve we continue to grow!

As Director of Online Education I am heading the efforts to improve and
grow our online program, update and oversee some of our large
undergraduate introductory courses (some sections a hybrid between
online and in person), and administer a few of our introductory
programming courses (flipped courses).
